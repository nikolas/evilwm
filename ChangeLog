*** Old ChangeLog:
	Released version 0.3.3.

2000-10-26
	Updated aewm license info by request.
	XK_Insert does same as XK_KP_Insert - may have to rethink that as
	  it's a 4-key chord on a happy hacking.  Almost as bad as emacs!
	Alt+Tab warps account for border width

2000-10-27
	Cleared out // comments.
	Now gets the border the right size when a window resizes itself.
	First window gets an active border now.

2000-10-31
	Updated aewm license info again ;)
	Released version 0.3.4.

2000-11-06
	Some code tidyups.
	Looked into the gravity code and made it more right.

2000-11-07
	Divide XxY display by increments if bit set whilst resizing/moving.
	Released version 0.3.5.
	Shaved some bytes off by grabbing keys in a loop.
	-bw option to change border width.
	Also changed all other options to single - due to making more sense

2000-11-08
	Stop remembering the name of the window.
	Fixed that daft "last window's gone, can't do anything" bug
	Realised we don't care if window is transient - nothing happens anyway.
	Use some simple fork/exec code instead of system()
	... but managed to save space elsewhere just by altering the logic

2001-01-15
	Merged the virtual window manager hack in - edit Makefile to include
	-DVWM to use.  It should be noted that at the moment for any
	"official" packages, I'd prefer this was left out...
	Released version 0.3.7.

2001-01-22
	-DSOLIDDRAG now enables..  er..  solid drags.  Which look nice but
	wouldn't be splendid on a slow machine.

2001-01-25
	Removed atdot address from docs.

2001-01-31
	-DSTDIO is needed to include various error/help messages.  Basically
	I looked at swm and saw one of its methods of shaving bytes.
	INSTALL file provided to explain all the -Ds.
	If a window tries to start itself iconised, map it.  That way we
	shouldn't get some weirdnesses (tho it might be rude).
	With minimal options, evilwm now comes out to <15K under Linux :)

2001-02-04
	Released 0.3.8.

2001-02-08
	move() takes extra parameter indicating new location has already been
	set.  Thus, new coords are set in event handler for key commands.
	This gets rid of my dodgy XPutBackEvent hack.

2001-02-10
	Fixed unfocused Alt+Tab again.
	Colourmap handling optional, only needed for non-truecolour displays.
	Rolled event loop up into main() where it belongs (I reckon)
	Released 0.3.9.

2001-02-11
	Added maximise/vertical maximise.
	Looked at solid resize - decided it was a pretty terrible idea.
	Made mouse control optional(!)

2001-02-14
	Rewrote the README.
	Realised I didn't have to translate virtual desktops into 0-7, I can
	just use the keysym value.

2001-02-16
	Found the bug that was indirectly causing infinite loops with virtual
	desktops enabled.  XNextEvent raising an X error - hmm, doesn't say
	that could happen in the docs.  I don't like the current fix, which is
	flag handle_xerror to ignore during that call.

2001-02-17
	Ah.  After switching desktops, unmapping one window could cause an
	enter event for another.  By the time the handler is called, that
	window is also unmapped, so anything you try and do to handle the
	event causes the xerror.  Sorted :)

2001-02-18
	Released 0.3.10.

2001-02-21
	Received code from Peter Bailey to implement Ctrl+Alt+[Left|Right]
	vdesk switching.  Opinion around the office is that this is a Good
	Thing, but not to let it cycle around (e.g., from vdesk 8 to vdesk 1).
	So that's what I've put in.  Unfortunately reintroduces dependency
	on XK_1-XK_8 being contiguous.

2001-05-24
	Received a patch from Dave Holland to fix the ordering problem with
	virtual desktops.  Works well, but I think an extra parameter to
	unhide() is tidier, so I've done that instead.  Much thanks anyway :)

	Did some research into Wayne Myers' inane crash.  Another spurious
	XError.  So far I've turned the crash into a bug - a 17x17 square
	remains on the screen.  Weird.

2001-06-02
	Well, by simply setting up to ignore the XError, I've "fixed" the
	bug.  Strange.  Tempted to blame GTK+ for now.

	Changed default Makefile to build virtual desktops in, as that's
	what seems to break most frequently; and enable solid drags, as
	that's what I use.

	Released 0.3.11.

2001-07-13
	Added -V option.

	Start the run up to 1.0.  Hopefully this will involve solving the
	IE bug, but right now I'm not very concerned about it.

2001-08-24
	Grab everything with Mod3Mask as well - this should circumvent the
	NumLock problem.

2002-01-03
	If an app maps itself (EVIL!  EVIL!  EVIL!), switch to the virtual
	desktop it's on before raising it.

2002-01-22 (vatten@users.sourceforge.net)
	Added support for vdesk - an external virtual desktop manager
	that works by iconifying windows and mapping them back again.
 
2002-01-24 (vatten@users.sourceforge.net)
	Added support for the combination of vdesk and the internal
	virtual desktop manager.

2002-01-25
	Move all the key bindings out into a separate include file and
	add a line in Makefile to override KILL key (for Cygwin).

2002-02-28
	Released 0.99.4.

2002-03-04
	A window that changes size to be >= width/height of screen with
	x=0 or y=0 is probably trying to fullscreen, so shift it left/up
	by border width in those cases.

2002-03-12
	Alerted to the fact that BSD make doesn't support static pattern
	rules, but checked with a BSD user that 'make allinone' does in
	fact work.  Included a note to the effect that BSD users should
	use that.
	Ok, noticed that this functionality isn't even required, so
	made it into something that works on both :)
	Made move/resize raise the window before doing anything.

2002-03-25
	Set a global variable while quitting.
	Changed way spawn() works - it now fork()s twice.

2002-03-26
	Wait until pointer has moved at least 6 pixels before starting to
	move a window - hopefully will mostly eliminate my nicely aligned
	windows becoming slightly crooked just because I raised one.

2002-08-19
	Released 0.99.7.
	Received patch from Dave Holland to adjust position of *new* windows
	trying to fullscreen.

2002-08-21
	Finally applied kludge from David Flynn that fixes the IE bug.
	IE is basically doing some *REALLY BAD THINGS*, and neither of us
	know why, but he traced it down to generating a single specific
	xerror which we can happily ignore.

2002-08-22
	Manpage updates.

2002-09-25
	When removing a window, map it before destroying its parent (the
	border).  This should stop things disappearing if you quit evilwm
	while using virtual desktops (thanks to Paul Whittaker).
	Changed default font to 'variable' which should exist even if
	'lucidasans-10' doesn't (thanks to Paul Whittaker and Dan Field).

2002-09-27
	Fix non-soliddrags (broken since 2002-03-26 edit, it seems).

2002-10-17
	Add a new window information banner (displayed while moving, resizing
	or holding down Ctrl+Alt+I).  Enabled with -DINFOBANNER.
	Turn off autorepeat while Ctrl+Alt+I is held down.
	Released 0.99.8.

2002-11-07
	Fix potential divide-by-zero for clients that misreport their
	geometry divisors.
	Released 0.99.9.

2002-11-09
	Add a call to setsid() to put spawned xterms into their own process
	group.  Should finally stop them disappearing on wm exit.
	Fullscreen fixes, tested with xv ('m') and mplayer ('f').

2002-11-10
	Hopefully fixed the "grey squares" problem by seeing if an XError
	occurred before we got to set up a new client window.
	-DINFOBANNER and -DINFOBANNER_MOVERESIZE are now separated so you
	can enable it for Ctrl+Alt+I but disable it for move/resize where
	it would slow everything down.
	When a window is removed, don't reset current window unless this
	*was* the current window.  This means all background windows should
	grey out properly now.
	Released 0.99.10.

	Documentation updates.
	Added -DMWM_HINTS (code taken from aewm) as a way of determining
	if a border is required for a client.

2002-11-11
	Using -display will also set an environment variable DISPLAY= to
	be inherited by children.
	Hopefully stop the NumLock related bug reports once and for all by
	figuring out which modifier is attached to XK_Num_Lock and grabbing
	all keys with that, caps lock and both.  Shifting which modifier
	Num_Lock is bound to with xmodmap seems to show this working.

2002-11-12
	Released 0.99.11.

	Fix a small memory leak (and free another allocation that wouldn't
	leak).
	Make vdesk-changing "autowarp" an option after realising how annoying
	it was.
	Abstracted out the change-border-colour code into a separate function.
	This is tidier and results in a smaller binary.

2002-11-18
	Fixed Alt-Tab-into-nowhere bug that I think would cause an infinite
	loop if you tried Alt-Tab on an empty virtual desktop.
	Extended the NumLock keyboard fixes to the mouse button grabs.

2002-11-19
	Ripped out most of the VDESK_BOTH code (which didn't work) and
	replaced it with code that just calls the 'vdesk' application (which
	does).

2002-11-20
	Abstract a couple more grabs out into macros - code tidy.

2002-11-23
	Fix small problem with border colours in new code.
	Documentation updates.  Re-fix multihead "support".

2002-11-24
	Better multihead support - entering managed screen will grab keyboard
	events, leaving will deselect "current" window.
	Documentation updates.
	Released 0.99.12.

	Argh!  Only set focus to PointerRoot on entering root window if we
	don't have a current window (I'd killed sloppy focus...)

2002-11-26
	Released 0.99.13.

	First draft proper multihead support - looks like it's working,
	needs a bit of testing.

2003-01-15
	No complaints so...
	Released 0.99.14.

2003-06-10
	Warp mouse to topleft before bottomright for small viewport users.

	Fix the xpdf problem (started up in tiny window), hopefully doesn't
	break anything else (XSizeHints manpage suggests width/height hints
	are obsolete).

2003-06-27
	Applied Larry's identifier shadowing changes, and malloc return
	value checks.

2003-06-29
	Released 0.99.15.

2003-07-23
	Dave Holland sent a patch to fix some Alt+Tab misbehaviour.

2003-09-18
	Fixed "losing control of windows" problem when switching desktops
	rapidly on slow machines.
	Released 0.99.16.

2003-09-25
	Hopefully *really* fix that bug.  Testers suggest to me that it is
	now really gone.

2003-10-15
	Integrated a patch from Neil Drumm to implement snap-to-border.
	Run evilwm with -snap num to enable the behaviour (num specifies
	the proximity in pixels to snap to - 10 is quite nice).
	It's worth noting that Per Weijnitz sent a similar patch a while
	ago, but I never got around to using it :(
	Released 0.99.17.

2004-07-10
	Fix Alt+Tab crash when there are no clients.

2004-07-11
	Coalesce move() and resize() into moveresize().
	Refactor window move/resize-by-mouse to eliminate arg to moveresize().

2004-07-12
	Added -app option to specify default vdesk (incl sticky), positions
	and dimensions.

2004-07-13
	Fix so shape information is applied on WM startup.

2005-03-19
	Split geometry and vdesk out of -app option into separate -g and -v
	options (each apply to the last -app defined).

2005-03-20
	Add -mask1 and -mask2 switches to override default modifier grabs.

2005-03-29
	Tidy client_update_current using Larry Doolittle's patch.

2005-03-30
	Handle applications reparenting a window to root - manage them unless
	in Withdrawn state.

2005-04-04
	Use strchr,strrchr instead of index,rindex.
	Set border size to frame size when unmanaging window.

2005-04-06
	Return to properly implemented interpretation of win_gravity on
	initial mapping of windows.
	Restore window's original border width on WM exit.

2005-04-20
	Remove deprecated 'vdesk' external pager support.

2005-04-25
	Merging Larry Doolittle's patches: Stricter warning settings for gcc.
	LD: Cast unused parameters to void.

2005-04-26
	Applied LD's patch to declare opt_term statically for now (intent
	is to allow arguments to program specified with -term).
	LD: Try to print ssize_t correctly and within strict standards.
	LD: Add $(EXTRA_DEFINES) to Makefile.
	LD: Improve punctuation in comments.
	LD: Use long instead of CARD32 for argument to XChangeProperty()
	due to odd X Consortium decision.
	LD: Un-shadow variable p in remove_client debugging segment.
	LD: Assign opt_term at compile time instead of malloc.
	LD: Fuss with execvp casting and comments (edited for brevity by CA).

2005-06-02
	Ignore PPosition during window placement (back to old behaviour of
	positioning window under pointer unless user-specified).
	Released 0.99.18.

2005-10-06
	Info window movement made a bit more sensible.
	Don't remove clients from within error handler, instead flag for
	removal.
	While removing client, only reparent to root if window is withdrawn
	or window manager is shutting down (fixes xpdf-in-firefox bug).
	Window close key with shift held will XKillClient().
	LD: Replace logic to decide if we have a shaped window (cribbed from
	fvwm-2.5.10).
	LD: Warp mouse pointer to a visible point in shaped windows.

2005-12-29
	Documentation updates.

2005-12-30
	Released 0.99.19.

2006-01-09
	Removed dependency on Motif header files: supply just as much hint
	structure information as is necessary to interpret Motif hints.
	Added fix_client() function.
	Bundle XKillClient option into send_wm_delete()
	Discard enter events on window move, etc.; simpler than searching
	through shape extents.

2006-01-10
	Collapse maximise_vert() and maximise_horiz() into single
	maximise_client() that can handle any combination.
	CARD32 also seemingly not appropriate for flags field of XSizeHints.

2006-01-13
	Switch to using a window border for frame's colour, don't touch
	frame background.  This allows aterm's "fast transparency" to work.
	Only map a window when managing it if it's supposed to be visible,
	instead of mapping then immediately unmapping.
	Released 0.99.20.

2006-01-16
	Various documentation fixes from Larry Doolittle.
	LD: new.c: nitems_return in get_property() should be unsigned.
	LD: screen.c: draw_outline() is only needed if mouse support or no
	info banner support is compiled in.
	ButtonPress notifications shouldn't be needed on root windows: removed.
	events.c: Fix positioning error in handle_configure_request().
	Released 0.99.21.

2006-01-18
	EWMH hints added so vdesk/sticky states persist across wm change.

2006-01-25
	Alt+Tab behaviour modified to be more in line with what most people
	expect (single Alt+Tab goes back to previously selected window).
	Added -altmask to override Shift as default control behaviour change
	key.
	Added resizing with Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[HJKL].

2006-01-26
	Released 0.99.22.

2006-02-06
	Fixed -v option parsing (thanks to Robert Blacquiere).
	Released 0.99.23.

2006-02-07
	Remove unused def_cmap field from ScreenInfo struct.

2006-02-10
	Added -nosoliddrag option (thanks to Erik Auerswald).

2006-02-17
	Rewrite grab_keysym() macro as a function.

2006-02-20
	Released 0.99.24.
